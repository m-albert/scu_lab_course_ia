# E3: Segmentation

**~50 min.** From an image to counted, measured objects.

## Preparation

Open `data/bbbc020/images/2h_1_nuclei.tif`.

Keep the original open and unmodified throughout. Work on duplicates
(`Image ▸ Duplicate…`, Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+D). You will want to compare.

## Part 1: thresholding

1. Open `Image ▸ Adjust ▸ Threshold…` (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+T). Drag the sliders and
   watch the red overlay. **Find a setting by eye that captures the nuclei and
   little else. What value did you land on?**

2. Now press **Auto**, and try the dropdown of methods: *Default*, *Otsu*,
   *Li*, *Triangle*. **Do they agree with each other? Do they agree with you?**

3. Pick Otsu and press **Apply** to get a binary mask.

```{admonition} What just happened to your image
:class: warning
Applying a threshold *replaces* the intensities with 0 and 255. The original
values are gone. This is why you duplicated first.
```

## Part 2: cleaning up

4. Look closely at the binary image. **Can you see small specks that are not nuclei? Are
   there nuclei with holes in them?**

5. Fill the holes with `Process ▸ Binary ▸ Fill Holes`.

6. Remove the specks with `Process ▸ Binary ▸ Open`. **What does "open" do?** Try
   `Erode` on its own and then `Dilate` on its own to find out.

## Part 3: measuring

7. Set up what you want measured: `Analyze ▸ Set Measurements…`. Tick **Area**,
   **Mean gray value**, **Min & max gray value** and **Shape descriptors**.

8. Run `Analyze ▸ Analyze Particles…` with *Size* `0-Infinity`, *Show* set to
   **Outlines**, and both *Display results* and *Summarize* ticked.

9. **How many nuclei did it find?**

10. The expert annotation for this field says **39**. Open
    `data/bbbc020/gt/2h_1_nuclei_labels.tif` to see them.
    **How close did you get? Where does your result disagree?**

11. Look closely at the outlines Fiji drew. **Find a place where two nuclei are
    touching.** What did `Analyze Particles` do there: did it count one object
    or two?

```{note}
`Analyze Particles` decides what counts as "an object" by following connected
runs of foreground pixels. Two nuclei that touch share a border, so they form one
connected region and are counted once. There is a way to separate them, and it is
the first thing covered in the Python notebooks, but it is worth seeing the problem
before seeing the fix.
```

## Part 4: measuring the *other* channel

Here is the step that makes this a real workflow rather than an exercise.

You have masks of the nuclei, made from the DAPI channel. But the interesting
question is usually about a *different* channel: how much CD11b is there, in
each cell?

12. Re-run `Analyze ▸ Set Measurements…` and set **Redirect to:** to
    `2h_1_cells.tif` (it must be open).

13. Run `Analyze ▸ Analyze Particles…` again on your mask.

14. **The areas are the same as before, but the mean gray values have changed.
    Why?** Make sure you can explain this to your neighbour: "redirect" is the
    single most useful checkbox in this dialog, and it is the thing you will do
    in your homework to measure GFP inside DAPI-defined nuclei.

## Part 5: the hard channel

15. Now try the whole pipeline again, from step 1, on
    `data/bbbc020/images/2h_1_cells.tif`. The annotation says **33** cells.

16. **How did it go?** Note that the object *count* may land near 33: do not let
    that reassure you. Look at the outlines. Some honest questions:
    - Is there a threshold value that captures the cells without merging them?
    - Do the cells have edges that a threshold can find at all?
    - What would you have to know about the image to do better?

If that felt unsatisfying, good. That is what [E4](e4_weka.md) is for.
