Fiji

```


**Fiji** is an image processing package—a "batteries-included" distribution of ImageJ, bundling a lot of plugins which facilitate scientific image analysis.

## About Fiji

Initially, the core of Fiji was **ImageJ** ([https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/)), an image analysis program extensively used in the biological sciences. ImageJ was originally developed by Wayne Rasband at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and first released in 1997. Due to its ease of use and the plug-ins architecture, ImageJ has seen innumerable contributions over the years that have massively extended its functionality. 

A recent collaborative project, **ImageJ2** ([https://imagej.net/software/imagej2/](https://imagej.net/software/imagej2/)), is redesigning the ImageJ foundations to allow for better separation between data model and user interface, support for N-dimensional datasets, strong focus on interoperability with other scientific tools, while still maintaining backwards compatibility with the original ImageJ software. ImageJ2 has recently replaced ImageJ at the core of Fiji. 

Fiji is released as open source under the GNU General Public License.

## Initial setup

Before we start, we need to configure Fiji so that we all have consistent behavior. First, pick the `Edit > Options > Colors` menu item and set the foreground, background and selection colors as shown below:

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/color_options.png
:height: 150px
:align: center

Color settings

```

Then, go to `Edit > Options > Startup` and choose `Black background ` from the pull-down menu at the bottom. The following text will be added: `setOption("BlackBackground", "true")`.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/binary_options_startup.png
:height: 300px
:align: center

Set black background option at startup

```

Please restart Fiji before continuing.

## The user interface

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/fiji.png
:width: 400px
:align: center

Fiji's user interface

```

The various operations in Fiji are accessible via the **menu** and the **toolbar**.

### Menu

The menu structure is organized as follows:

* **File**: Create, load, and save images.
* **Edit**: Edit the images, drawing options, application options.
* **Image**: Modify and adjust images, manage (hyper)stacks, apply transformations, manage colors and look-up tables.
* **Process**: Point operations, image arithmetics, filters.
* **Analyze**: Object measurements, statistics, histograms, plots.
* **Plugins**: Install and run macros and plug-ins.

### Toolbar

The toolbar contains functionality for interactive work on the image. We will have a look at some of those tools when we move to specific topics in the course.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/toolbar.png
:width: 400px
:align: center

The Fiji toolbar

```

### Finding commands

Commands in Fiji are scattered all over the place: if you know what you need but cannot remember where it is, you can type some keyword in the search bar and the Quick Search tool will provide you with a list of commands in Fiji and even information from the ImageJ Wiki and Forum.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/command_finder.png
:width: 400px
:align: center

The command finder

```

## Basic functionality

### Opening files

You can open files from `File > Open` or `File > Import` or by dragging a file from the Windows Explorer onto the Fiji window. A series of example images can be accessed from `File > Open Samples`.

### Saving files

Open images in Fiji can be saved to disk using `File > Save as`: several formats are supported. Recommended for scientific images is the TIFF format.

### Navigating images

The navigation toolbar allows to zoom in and out and to move around in case the image is too large or you zoomed in too much.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/navigation_toolbar.png
:align: center

The navigation tools

```



### Image calibration

When loading an image into Fiji for **measurements**, it is essential that the image calibration is correct. You can open the image properties window from the `Image > Properties` menu. Make sure that the pixel width and height and the voxel depth (*i.e.*, the distance between planes in a 3D acquisition) have the correct size; in case of time acquisition, also make sure that the frame interval is correct.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/calibration.png
:height: 300px
:align: center

Image calibration

```

### Regions of interest (ROIs)

**Regions of interest** (**ROIs**) are used to select a portion of the image for analysis or for other activities. Fiji supports several different types of ROIs.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/rois_toolbar.png
:width: 200px
:align: center

The ROI toolbar

```

The ROIs are divided into a number of classes: **rectangular**, **circular**, **polygon**, **freehand**, **line**, **angle** and **wand** tools. The small triangle at the bottom of some of the tools indicate that there are several variations: for instance, the circular tool can be expanded (with a right-click) to reveal a choice of **Oval selections**, **Elliptical selections**, and the **Selection Brush Tool**. Double clicking on a tool opens its settings dialog.

ROIs can be combined by holding the `SHIFT` key and subtracted from each other with the `ALT` key.

#### ROI Manager

Fiji allows one ROI to be added to the image at a time. To add and manage more ROIs, the ROI Manager may be used. You can access it from the **Analyze > Tools > ROI Manager…** menu.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/roi_manager.png
:height: 250px
:align: center

The ROI manager

```

To add ROIs to the manager, you hit the **Add** button after drawing each ROI. Click on **Show all** to display all ROIs on current image.

## Data types

Fiji supports several data types. They can be accessed from `Image > Type`.

|  Data type  |               Description                |
| :---------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|    8 bit    |    Unsigned integer 8 bit (0 .. 255)     |
|   16 bit    |   Unsigned integer 16 bit (0 .. 65535)   |
|   32 bit    |     Single-precision floating point      |
| 8 bit Color |        Indexed 8 bit color image         |
|  RGB Color  | Full color image, 3 channels Red, Green, Blue |
|  RGB Stack  | 3 separate channels, for Red, Green and Blue components |
|  HSB Stack  | Image in HSB color space (Hue, Saturation and Brightness) |
|  Lab Stack  | Image in Lab color space (Luminance and 2 color channels) |

Some data types are completely inter-convertible. Some may cause information loss.

## Look-up tables (LUTs)

In our course we will concentrate on single- or multi-channel intensity images, such as those obtained from a light microscope. The only information stored in such an image is the intensity of the original signal (*e.g.*, fluorescent light) at each pixel position. By default, then, intensity images are displayed as gray-scale images with black pixels mapped to the intensity 0 and white pixels mapped to 255 (for 8-bit images) or 65535 (for 16-bit images).

Often, however, microscopy images were taken for more than one *channel*. Each channel collected the light from a different fluorophore. GFP emits light in the green range of wavelengths of visible light; DAPI in the blue; Rhodamine B in the red; YFP in the yellow, and so on.

When displaying more than one channel at the same time in a **composite image,** we want to make use of their original colors to distinguish the different contributions and study possible colocalization of fluorescent proteins.

A lookup-table is a mapping of intensity values to a given color in a table. You can access a series of predefined LUTs from the `Image > Lookup Tables` menu or from the toolbar (the `LUT` tool).

LUTs can be monochromatic (as for instance `Grays`, `Red`, `Green`, or `Blue`) or multi-color. 

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/LUTs.png
:width: 400px
:align: center

Lookup tables (for the Neuron sample image)

```

## Image histogram

Let's have a look at the histogram of an image. Open `data/fiji/histogram/FITC.tif` in Fiji.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/FITC.png
:width: 300px
:align: center

The FITC.tif image

```

Now have a look at its intensity distribution: `Analyze > Histogram`.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/histogram.png
:width: 200px
:align: center

Histogram of FITC.tif

```

Hit the `Log` button to superimpose the histogram in logarithmic scale (gray) on top of the one in linear scale (black). The black curve shows that most intensities are very dark, which is to be expected since the image is mostly background. The logarithmic scale shows us that there are still some pixels that cover all the range up to 65535; they are just very few.

## Adjusting brightness and contrast

### Histogram stretch

To adjust the contrast of the `FITC.tif` image, pick `Image > Adjust > Brightness/Contrast`. Set the maximum at around 20000.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/histogram_stretch.png
:height: 300px
:align: center

Histogram stretch

```



While you move the sliders, the image contrast will update in real time. Be aware that the actual pixel intensities in the image are left untouched!

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/FITC_stretched.png
:width: 300px
:align: center

FITC image with maximum at 19987

```

The `Brightness & Contrast` tool offers three options:

* **Auto**: automatically set minimum and maximum intensity values to give an optimal contrast
* **Reset**: reset the minimum value to 0 and the maximum to the maximum allowed value of the data type
* **Apply**: change the pixel intensities in the image to fit the new range. **Careful**: this modifies your image!

For this exercise, we will hit `Apply`. Then, apply the `HiLo` lookup table. All pixels appearing in blue are pixels at value 0, and all pixels appearing red are pixels at the maximum value for the data type. If you see too many red pixels, it means that you probably went too low with the maximum and **saturated** the pixels!

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/FITC_saturated.png
:width: 300px
:align: center

FITC image with maximum at 19987

```

### Histogram equalization

Histogram equalization Fiji is launched via `Process > Enhance Contrast`. 

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/histogram_equalize.png
:width: 150px
:align: center

Parameters for histogram equalization

```

Optionally, one can ignore the very dark and very light pixels by setting a fraction (in %) of saturated pixels that are left out from the equalization (they will be set to 0 and the max intensity value of the data type, respectively). Notice, that `Normalize` performs histogram stretch as we have seen in the `Brightness & Contrast` tool. If one unchecks both options, the contrast is normalized only for display.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/FITC_histeq.png
:width: 300px
:align: center

FITC.tif after histogram equalization

```

## Filters

In this section, we will test several filters on the `data/fiji/filters/actin.tif` image.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/actin.png
:width: 150px
:align: center

The actin.tif image

```

Notice that the `actin.tif` image has the following calibration: 1 pixel = 0.467 $\mu m$.

### Spatial filters

#### Linear filters

Images are filtered in the spatial domain by the operation of **convolution** with a **kernel** whose weights are carefully selected to perform a specific transformation on the pixel of the image. Fiji implements a series of linear filters in the `Process > Filters` menu.

##### Average filter

We will start by running an **average filter** on the `actin.tif` image by defining our own $5x5$ kernel in `Process > Filters > Convolve`. We need a filter with homogeneous weights that sum up to 1.
```{math}
h = \frac{1}{25}\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\
    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\
    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{1}{25} & \frac{1}{25} & \frac{1}{25} & \frac{1}{25} & \frac{1}{25}\\
    \frac{1}{25} & \frac{1}{25} & \frac{1}{25} & \frac{1}{25} & \frac{1}{25}\\
    \frac{1}{25} & \frac{1}{25} & \frac{1}{25} & \frac{1}{25} & \frac{1}{25}\\
    \frac{1}{25} & \frac{1}{25} & \frac{1}{25} & \frac{1}{25} & \frac{1}{25}\\
    \frac{1}{25} & \frac{1}{25} & \frac{1}{25} & \frac{1}{25} & \frac{1}{25}
\end{bmatrix}
```

Luckily, Fiji can do the normalization for us, and we can just type the $5x5$ ones in the dialog:

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/convolver_average_filter.png
:width: 200px
:align: center

$5x5$ average filter (to be normalized by Fiji)

```



The convolution with our average filter gives us the following result:

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/actin_average_filter.png
:width: 300px
:align: center

Average filter

```

Notice that Fiji also offers the `Process > Filter > Mean...` filter, that uses an average filter of approximately circular shape (by setting all weights farther away than one radius of the circle from the center of the kernel to zero).

##### Gaussian filter

We could run a **Gaussian filter** on the `actin.tif` image by defining a $5x5$ kernel in `Process > Filters > Convolve`, but it is much easier to use the `Process > Filter Gaussian Blur...`. The only parameter to the Gaussian kernel is its $\sigma$ value, but please notice the it can be specified either in pixels or in units.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/convolver_gaussian_filter.png
:width: 150px
:align: center

Options of the Gaussian filter

```

The convolution with our Gaussian filter gives us the following result:

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/actin_gaussian_filter.png
:width: 300px
:align: center

Gaussian filter

```



##### Laplacian filter

To run a **Laplacian filter** on the `actin.tif` image, we first change the data type to `Image > Type > 32-bit`, since the Laplacian creates negative values in the image that would be clipped if the image were 8 bit. Then we can define our kernel (without normalization!) in the Convolver window.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/convolver_laplacian_filter.png
:width: 200px
:align: center

Options of the Laplacian filter

```

The convolution with our Laplacian filter gives us the following result:

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/actin_laplacian_filter.png
:width: 300px
:align: center

Laplacian filter

```

##### Laplacian of Gaussian filter

In analogy to the previous filter, to run a **Laplacian of Gaussian filter** on the `actin.tif` image, we first change the data type to `Image > Type > 32-bit`, since the Laplacian creates negative values in the image that would be clipped if the image were 8 bit. We could first filter with a Gaussian filter and then apply the Laplacian; instead, we use the `Plugins > FeatureJ > FeatureJ Laplacian` plug-in.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/convolver_log_filter.png
:width: 150px
:align: center

Options of the Laplacian of Gaussian filter

```

The smoothing scale is the $\sigma$  value of the Gaussian kernel.

The convolution with our Laplacian of Gaussian filter gives us the following result:

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/actin_log_filter.png
:width: 300px
:align: center

Laplacian filter

```

#### Non-linear filters

Non-linear filters cannot be implemented by the convolution operator, since as their name implies, they do not perform any linear operation (*i.e.*, additions and multiplications) on the pixel neighborhood.

##### Order filters

The **min**, **median** and **max** filters can be run with the `Process > Filters > Minimum...`,  `Process > Filters > Median...`, and  `Process > Filters > Maximum...` commands, respectively. All filters take the radius as input argument:

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/median_filter.png
:width: 150px
:align: center

Median filter options

```

The result of the order filter on the `actin.tif` image looks as follows:

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/actin_order_filters.png
:width: 600px
:align: center

Order filters

```

### Frequency filters

Filtering in the frequency domain consists of modifying the Fourier transform of an image and then computing the inverse transform to obtain the processed result. We will not discuss frequency filters further in this course.

## Background subtraction

There are many reasons why one might want to run a background subtraction before analysis. In microscopy acquisitions, it is common for images to display a reduced intensity away from the center of the image. This so called **shading** can make it more difficult to segment objects unless one uses a local thresholding strategy. For **ratiometric analyses**, where one locally calculates the ratio of the signal between two channels, any intensity offset due to unspecific light in the background must be removed; otherwise, especially for weak signals, the ratio of the background values dominates the overall ratio!

Open the image `data/fiji/background/cell_shaded.tif`.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/background_cell_shaded.png
:width: 400px
:align: center

The shaded image

```

Open `Process > Subtract Background...`.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/background_subractor.png
:width: 150px
:align: center

The Subtract Background tool

```

You can `Preview` the changes  or even see the estimated background before subraction (`Create background (don't subtract)`). Hit `OK` when you are done.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/background_cell_shaded_corrected.png
:width: 400px
:align: center

The background-subtracted image

```

## Segmentation

### Simple threshold-based segmentation

Often we want to extract objects from images with the goal of measuring several features that we can use to test some hypothesis. It is important then, to preserve their shapes as much as possible. Ideally, the objects have a (more or less homogeneous) intensity that is clearly higher than the local background surrounding them.

Open the image `data/fiji/segmentation/Nuclei.tif`.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/nuclei.png
:width: 400px
:align: center

Nuclei.tif image

```

To segment, use `Image > Adjust > Threshold...`. Choose the `Otsu` algorithm. A preview of the segmentation will be overlaid on top of the image.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/nuclei_segmentation_otsu.png
:width: 400px
:align: center

Segmentation preview

```

In this dataset, the Otsu algorithm performs satisfactorily. If the intensity of the objects tends to vary a lot, however, Otsu might perform sub-optimally. 

Compare the Otsu segmentation with the one obtained by the `Li` or the `Triangle` algorithms. These algorithms are particularly robust to segment objects that have a wide range of intensities. 

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/nuclei_segmentation_li.png
:width: 400px
:align: center

Segmentation with the Li algorithm

```

Hit `Apply` to create a black and white mask that we can later use for analysis (in a later section).

### Local maxima detection

Sometimes, we only need to count objects in the image and do not need a precise segmentation of their boundaries.

Open the image `data/fiji/segmentation/Cell.tif`.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/cell.png
:width: 400px
:align: center

Cell.tif image

```

Segmenting the cells is tricky, since their cytoplasms are dim and the cells are very close to one another. An easier way to count the cells is to count their nuclei.

Go to `Process > Find Maxima...`.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/cell_find_maxima_settings.png
:width: 150px
:align: center

Find Maxima settings

```

Enable the preview and play with the `Noise tolerance` until you see one cross per nucleus.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/cell_maxima_points.png
:width: 400px
:align: center

Find Maxima preview

```

Once you are satisfied, hit `OK`.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/cell_maxima_count.png
:width: 200px
:align: center

Find Maxima results

```

## Morphology

We will look at some applications of morphology in Fiji by loading and badly segmenting the image `data/fiji/morphology/actin.tif`.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/actin.png
:width: 150px
:align: center

Actin.tif

```

Use the `Image > Adjust >Threshold` tool to segment the image with the `Moments` algorithm. Hit `Apply` to create a binary mask.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/actin_segmented_moments.png
:width: 150px
:align: center

(Badly) segmented Actin.tif

```

If you analyze the result of this segmentation (`Analyze > Analyze Particles...`) you will see that there are 24 distinct objects in the binary mask (more on **Measurements** later in the course). 

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/actin_thresholded_measurements.png
:width: 200px
:align: center

Initial analysis

```

Obviously, there is only one cell in the image, and our segmentation failed to recognized that.

### Dilation

We will start by running one **dilation** step on the image. Pick `Process > Binary > Dilate`.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/actin_dilated.png
:width: 150px
:align: center

Dilated Actin.tif

```

### Hole filling

Then, we fill the remaining holes with `Process > Binary > Fill Holes`.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/actin_filled.png
:width: 150px
:align: center

Filled Actin.tif

```

### Erosion

Since the dilation step extended the outline of the cell outward, we would overestimate the area of the cell if we were to measure it now. Therefore, we run an erosion step to bring the cell outline back to the original position. Use `Process > Binary > Erode`.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/actin_eroded.png
:width: 150px
:align: center

Eroded Actin.tif

```

Now we get a better result from our analysis:

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/actin_corrected_measurements.png
:width: 200px
:align: center

Measurement on processed Actif.tif

```

## Measurements

We have seen a few of the fundamental **image processing** concepts that we can use to manipulate our images for various types of applications. In this course, we are interested in extracting measurement data from our images. We are scientists after all!

In the next sections, we will see a few examples of **image analysis** workflows.

### Time series analysis from manual ROIs

In this example we will analyze intensity spikes in a calcium flux experiment. Open the image `./data/fiji/measurements/manual_rois/Calcium Flux.tif`. 

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/calcium_flux.png
:width: 300px
:align: center

Calcium flux time series

```

It you scroll through time using the **time slider** at the bottom of the image, you will see that the signal intensity within the cellular cytoplasm flashes over time. How can we plot an intensity profile?

Pick the **oval** ROI from the Fiji toolbar.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/rois_toolbar_oval.png
:align: center

ROIs in the Fiji toolbar

```

Draw the ROI in one of the flashing regions.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/calcium_flux_roi.png
:width: 300px
:align: center

Our ROI

```

Run the `Image > Stacks > Plot Z-axis Profile` command to get a line profile. 

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/calcium_flux_line_profile.png
:width: 300px
:align: center

Line profile

```

Hit the `List` button to see the corresponding mean gray values in the **Plot Values** table.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/calcium_flux_plot_values.png
:width: 200px
:align: center

Line profile values

```

What if you want to measure more than one ROI at a time? You can use the **ROI Manager** (`Analyze > Tools > ROI Manager...`) to keep track of all the ROIs you add to an image.

After drawing a ROI, hit the `t` key or push the `Add` button on the ROI manager to add current ROI to the list of ROIs on the image. If the original names are a bit confusing, you can hit the `Rename` button and give them more useful names.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/calcium_flux_roi_manager.png
:width: 150px
:align: center

ROI Manager in action

```

By checking the `Show All` option, all ROIs are shown on the image at the same time; otherwise only the active one is shown.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/calcium_flux_multiple_rois.png
:width: 300px
:align: center

Multiple ROIs on the image

```



Please notice that besides three flashing cells (`Cell1`, `Cell2`, and `Cell3`), we also added a `Background` ROI for the image background (to check how the global intensity in the scene changes over time), and an `InactiveCell` ROI to investigate what happens within a cell that does not seem to do much.

In `Analyze > Set Measurements` check the `Mean gray value` measurement as follows:

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/manual_roi_set_measurements.png
:width: 200px
:align: center

Set measurements

```

To measure over many ROIs at once, click on the `More >>` button in the ROI Manager and then pick `Multi Measure` (also, make sure to `Deselect` any ROIs you have selected in the ROI Manager) .

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/calcium_flux_multi_measure_options.png
:width: 150px
:align: center

Multi Measure options

```

This time you get no plot, but 5 columns that you can then export into your favorite spreadsheet tool for plotting.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/calcium_flux_multiple_rois_plot_values.png
:width: 300px
:align: center

Plot values for multiple ROIs

```

To measure just the active ROI in the image, you can simply hit `Measure` in the ROI Manager.

### Time series analysis from automatic ROIs

Placing one or two ROIs in an image is an acceptable effort, but if one has to analyze hundred of cells, it quickly becomes tedious and error-prone.

In the **Segmentation** section we saw how to extract a binary mask of all the cells in an image. Let's do something similar here for the analysis of calcium spikes in many cells at once.

Open the image `data/fiji/measurements/auto_rois/Calcium Sensing.tif`.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/calcium_sensing.png
:width: 300px
:align: center

The Calcium Sensing image

```

Going through the time series, we see that the cells do not move. Our strategy, then, is to create a mask for each cell that we can use to extract measurements over time.

Start by creating a **maximum intensity projection** of the data set via `Image > Stacks > Z Project...` using the following parameters:

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/calcium_sensing_max_proj_settings.png
:width: 150px
:align: center

Max intensity projection parameters

```

The max intensity projection algorithm creates a 2D image $I$ from a 3D stack $S$, by storing at each position $I(x, y)$ the maximum intensity $i_{max} = \max_{z=1}^{z=z_{max}}(S(x, y, z))$.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/calcium_sensing_max_proj.png
:width: 300px
:align: center

The maximum intensity projection

```

To create the mask, we can run:

* a Gaussian filter (`Process > Filters > Gaussian Blur...` with $\sigma=1 \mu m$) 
* a  Li threshold (`Image > Adjust > Threshold`) 
* the Watershed algorithm (`Process > Binary > Watershed`)

This should be our current result:

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/calcium_sensing_mask.png
:width: 300px
:align: center

The mask

```

Now, we can create a *particle* for each cell by running `Analyze > Analyze Particles...` 

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/calcium_sensing_analyze_particles.png
:width: 200px
:align: center

Analyze particles

```

We set a filter on the size (`50-Infinity`) to remove small debris from the segmentation and tick the `Add to Manager` check box to make sure to add all the generated ROIs to the ROI Manager.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/calcium_sensing_roi_manager.png
:width: 150px
:align: center

The ROI Manager with the extracted masks

```

You should probably add a manual ROI to the background as well (ROI 21 in the figure below).

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/calcium_sensing_rois.png
:width: 300px
:align: center

Obtained ROIs (ROI 21 is the manual background)

```

To transfer the ROIs to the original time series, we can activate the window where we loaded the original `Calcium Sensing.tif` image and click on `Show All` in the ROI Manager. The ROIs will now be associated to the `Calcium Sensing.tif` image. Alternatively, you could first hit `More >> Save...` in the ROI Manager to save the ROIs to disk and then load them from disk via `More >> Open...` (clear the listed ROIs first!).

Finally, we can measure our calcium profiles via `More >> Multi Measure` (enable `One row per slice`).

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/calcium_sensing_plot_values.png
:width: 300px
:align: center

Obtained ROIs (ROI 21 is the manual background)

```

## Image arithmetics

Often, it is very useful to use arithmetic operations between images; for instance, to subtract the estimated background from the image to correct for *shading* artifacts; or to **mask** one channel with another. 

In this section, we will see an example of masking.

Open `data/fiji/arithmetics/cell_2_channels.tif`.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/cell_2_channels.png
:width: 150px
:align: center

2-channel image

```

With `Image > Colors > Split Channels` we extract each of the two channels to its own window. Make a copy of the red channel with `Image > Duplicate`: we will need it later.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/cell_2_channels_split.png
:width: 300px
:align: center

Split channels

```

Now, we Gaussian filter (`Process > Filters > Gaussian Blur`) both channels with $\sigma=1$  pixel. 

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/cell_2_channels_gauss.png
:width: 150px
:align: center

Gaussian blur

```

Then we apply the Otsu threshold `Image > Adjust > Threshold...`  and close remaining holes inside the cell cytoplasm with `Process > Binary > Fill Holes`. We should now have two masks as depicted below.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/cell_2_channels_split_masks.png
:width: 300px
:align: center

The masks for each of the channels

```

Now, we would like to measure the signal intensity in the cell cytoplasm without taking into account the area covered by the nucleus. For this purpose, we can create a new mask that represents the difference of the two we just created. We can achieve this in two ways. The first way is by **subtracting** one image from the other. Open `Process > Image Calculator...`:

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/cell_2_channels_masks_subtract.png
:width: 200px
:align: center

Subtact one mask from the other

```

The second way, is by running the **logical operator XOR** on the images. XOR, or **exclusive OR** is a binary operation that returns **true** only if the two operands have different values (*i.e.*, one is **true** and the other is **false**). In a binary mask, this means that if two pixels at a given location are both black or both white, the result will be black; only if two pixels have different values (which in our case is the area of the cell **not** covered by the nucleus) we will get a white pixel.

Both operations return the same result:

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/cell_2_channels_result_mask.png
:width: 150px
:align: center

Result of the image arithmetics operation

```

Now we can use this mask to extract the mean intensity of the cell cytoplasm. Select the newly created mask and run `Analyze > Set Measurements`: make sure to redirect the measurements to the copy of the red channel we made in the beginning.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/cell_2_channels_set_measurements.png
:width: 200px
:align: center

Configure measurements to act on the desired image

```

And now hit `Analyse > Analyze Particles`. Make sure to **disable** `Include holes`.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/cell_2_channels_analyze_particles.png
:width: 200px
:align: center

Analyze particles

```

The mean intensity of the cytoplasm is returned.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/cell_2_channels_final_result.png
:width: 200px
:align: center

Final result

```

## Programming Fiji

There are fundamentally two ways of extending the functionality of Fiji:

- **Macros** are simple programs stored as `.ijm` (**I**mage**J** **M**acro) files and written in a language similar to Java. Macros can contain control flow structures (`if`, `while`, ...), operators (`+`, `-`, ...) and built-in functions (or commands). Macros can call other macros.
  - For a list of macro functions, pick `Help > Macro functions...` or go to [https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/developer/macro/functions.html](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/developer/macro/functions.html)
  - The official Reference guide can be found at [https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/macro_reference_guide.pdf](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/macro_reference_guide.pdf)
- **Plug-ins** are faster, more flexible and more powerful than macros and are written in the Java programming language. They have much deeper access to the core of Fiji but are also much more complex to develop.

In this course we will learn how to write macros.

### Macro programming

A **macro** is a  simple program that automates a series of ImageJ commands. In its simplest form, we do not even need to write any code! 

Let's open an image and proceed with creating our first macro! Make sure you have an image open in Fiji; if not, pick `data/fiji/programming/macro1/Nuclei.tif`.

We can record a macro by choosing `Plugins > Macros > Record…` and performing a series of operations in Fiji. Each operation (with its selected parameters) will be automatically added to the recorder.

Lets pick `Image > Adjust > Threshold...`. You should see the corresponding macro calls being added to the Recorder. Then, pick `Analyze > Set Measurements...` and uncheck everything but `Area`, `Mean gray value` and `Min & Max gray value`. Also, set `Redirect` to `None` and `Decimal planes (0 - 9)` to `3`. Finally, run `Analyze > Analyze Particles…`.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/macro_recorder.png
:width: 400px
:align: center

The macro recorder

```

 Once we are done adding commands to the macro, we can give a `Name` to the macro (in this case `First_Macro.ijm`), hit the `Create` button and get the new macro script opened in the **Script editor**.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/script_editor.png
:width: 400px
:align: center

The script editor

```

The original macro is now listed in the script editor, but it is not yet saved! Before doing anything else, then, we hit `File > Save as...` and write it to a folder of our choice.

The scripting editor is very powerful and, at the time of writing, supports ten different programming languages! For our course, we will focus on the original **ImageJ Macro Language** (`IJ1 Macro`).

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/scripting_languages.png
:width: 400px
:align: center

The scripting languages

```

Once we are ready with our first macro we have a few options:

* Hit the **Run** button and the macro will be run on the **currently active window**. If we haven't touched anything in the meanwhile, it will be the same image we used to create the macro. You can open another image, and then run the macro on that one.
* To add it to Fiji, select  `Plugins > Macros > Install` and choose the file you just saved. A new entry will be added to the `Plugins > Macros` menu. Notice, however, that by installing it this way it will be gone when you restart Fiji. To make it permanent, copy the macro file into `Fiji.app/plugins/Macros`, optionally in a subfolder.

#### A simple example

Let's open the image `data/fiji/programming/macro1/Nuclei.tif`.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/macro_nuclei.png
:width: 300px
:align: center

The 'Nuclei.tif' image

```

Then, we start recording our macro: `Plugins > Macros > Record...`.

##### Apply threshold

Launch the Threshold tool via `Image > Adjust > Threshold`. Pick the *Li* algorithm, since it works robustly with images with a broader range of intensities, check the `Dark background` option, and hit the `Apply` button. The Recorder window should look more or less like this:

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/macro_nuclei_threshold.png
:width: 400px
:align: center

The thresholding steps

```

##### Apply watershed

Some of the nuclei are fused into individual objects. To separate them, we run `Process > Binary > Watershed`. This will add the `run("Watershed");` command to the Recorder:

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/macro_nuclei_watershed.png
:width: 400px
:align: center

The watershed command is added

```

##### Perform measurements

Launch the measurement selection tool from `Analyze > Set measurements...` and enable `Area` and `Display label` as follows:

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/macro_nuclei_measurements.png
:height: 300px
:align: center

Set measurements

```

Now launch `Analyze > Analyze Particles...`  and configure it as in the figure below:

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/macro_nuclei_analyze_particles.png
:width: 200px
:align: center

Analyze particles

```

At this stage, the Recorder window should look like this:

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/macro_nuclei_final_macro.png
:width: 400px
:align: center

Updated Recorder window

```

If you have any calls to `selectWindow()`, please remove them. 

##### Save the macro and re-run it

Now give a name to the macro (such as `Cell_Count.ijm`) and hit `Create` to open it in the Script Editor. Save it to a place of your liking.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/macro_nuclei_final_script.png
:width: 400px
:align: center

Updated Recorder window

```

You are now ready to run the macro. Make sure the `Nuclei-1` image is the one selected and hit `Run`. You should get a `Summary` table like this:

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/macro_nuclei_measurements_summary.png
:width: 300px
:align: center

Summary of the measurements on `Nuclei-1`

```

Now open the image `data/fiji/programming/macro1/Nuclei 02.tif` and `Run` the macro again. You should get an additional entry in the Results table:

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/macro_nuclei_measurements_summary_2.png
:width: 300px
:align: center

Summary after running the macro again

```



#### A more complex example with some coding

Often, one can record a macro with a series of operations performed on one image, and then apply that same series of operations on another image and everything will work as expected. In some cases, however, the steps that are performed on the images might need to be somewhat changed or adapted and cannot be applied unmodified on different images.

The ImageJ macro language allows us to introduce some intelligence in our code to cope with these situations. 

To keep track of pieces of information or values that could be different in different runs of a macro, we need to use **variables**. A variable is a named tag for a value that can change (it's supposed to be variable, after all) across runs of a macro or even within the same run.

Let's open the **Script Editor** via `Plugins > New > Macro` or `File > New > Script` (in this case, make sure to set the `Language` to `IJ1 Macro`).

We will replicate the example from the **Fiji Training Notes** to merge three images into an RGB image.

First, we will write some **comment** at the top of the file to document what the macro is supposed to do. We write comments by prepending them with a double slash: `//`. This informs the macro interpreter that this is not code, and should not be executed. It is there for us, to remember what the code is going to do. 

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/macro2_comments.png
:width: 400px
:align: center

Code comments

```

Notice that the interpreter paints the comments green to easily distinguish them from the rest of the code.

##### Prompt the user to pick an image

In contrast to the previous macro, this time we need additional information to successfully process the sequence of operations. We need to know which (open) images to assign to the `DAPI`, the `FITC` and `DIC` channels of our RGB image.

As our first operation, we will ask the user to pick the DAPI image (*i.e.*, to click on it, so that it becomes the active image). 

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/macro2_select_image.png
:width: 400px
:align: center

Prompt the user

```

Notice that the interpreter painted `waitForUser` in yellow and `Select DAPI image` in purple. Yellow indicates Fiji commands recognized by the interpreter; purple is used for **strings** of text. Strings usually convey information for the user of the program: in this case it explains what to do.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/macro2_select_image_dialog.png
:width: 150px
:align: center

The select image Dialog

```

How do we pass the information on which image should be assigned to the `DAPI` channel to the program? We need to store the window title into a **variable**.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/macro2_get_image_title.png
:width: 400px
:align: center

Store the image title into a variable

```

Notice that the variable is painted black.

Now we can do the same for the other two images:

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/macro2_select_other_images.png
:width: 400px
:align: center

Picking the other two images

```

Open the images  `DAPI.tif`, `DIC.tif` and `FITC.tif` from `data/fiji/programming/macro2` and then `Run` the macro.

You should be able to select each of the three images, but then nothing will happen! We still haven't added any action to perform on the images!

##### Merge the images

To conclude our macro, we need to pass the three selected image names to the `Merge Channels` command as **input arguments** as follows:

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/macro2_completed.png
:width: 400px
:align: center

Merging the channels

```

The `run()` function runs any of the command that are listed in the various Fiji menus. After the command name, in this case `"Merge Channels..."` (from the `Image > Color` menu), we must specify the list of parameters the command takes. When running those commands from the menus, a **dialog** will open for the interactive setting of the requested values. When running the command in a macro via the `run()` function, those same parameters  must be explicitly added to the call.

How do we know which parameters are to be passed? The simplest way is to launch a command from the Fiji menus while recording a macro. The command will be added to the macro, and its parameters can then be adapted.

For instance, recording `Image > Color > Merge Channels...` and passing the following parameters:

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/macro2_merge_channels_dialog.png
:width: 150px
:align: center

Recording Merge Channels...

```

adds this to the macro:

```python
run("Merge Channels...", "c2=FITC.tif c3=DAPI.tif c4=DIC.tif ignore");
```

The argument is one long string: `"c2=FITC.tif c3=DAPI.tif c4=DIC.tif ignore"`. How can we build the same string in our macro when the file names are stored in variables? We need to build the string by **concatenating** string and variables.

If `nameDAPI` is `"FITC.tif"`, the **string concatenation** (with the operator `+`) `"c2=" + nameFITC` results in the string `"c2=FITC.tif"`. The complete command then looks like this:

```python
run("Merge Channels...", "c2="+nameFITC+" c3="+nameDAPI+" c4="+nameDIC+" ignore");
```

This is **almost** the final version and it will work as long as the names of the images do not contain blank spaces. To be robust against this case, we enclose the image names within square brackets:

```python
run("Merge Channels...", "c2=["+nameFITC+"] c3=["+nameDAPI+"] c4=["+nameDIC+"] ignore");
```
Try!

#### Batch processing

Batch processing allows to analyze many images without user intervention. Images are automatically loaded and processed from a user-specified directory and the results are stored in another folder.

Let's consider the `Cell_Count.ijm` macro we created earlier.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/macro_nuclei_final_script.png
:width: 400px
:align: center

The original Cell_Count.ijm macro

```

How should we modify it so that we can run it in batch mode over a directory full of images?

Let's open the original `Cell_Count.ijm` macro and save it as `Cell_Count_Batch.ijm`.

At the very top of the macro, we add code to ask the user to pick the source directory to process:

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/macro3_pick_directory.png
:width: 400px
:align: center

Pick the source directory

```

Detailed instructions on how the `getDirectory()` function can be used are found in the macro functions help at [https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/developer/macro/functions.html#G](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/developer/macro/functions.html#G) (or by picking `Help > Macro Functions...` and changing to the letter `G`).

Then we get all files in the directory and we sort them.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/macro3_get_sorted_files.png
:width: 400px
:align: center

Get the sorted file list

```

After **variables**, we are now going to use another fundamental tool of the macro (and any other) programming language: **control flow**. In particular, we will look at the **for loop**:

```java
for(i=0; i<10; i++) {
  ... statements ...
}
```

The for loop repeats a series of **statements** a certain number of times. The statements that belong to the for loop are contained between the two **curly braces** `{` and `}`. At each iteration of the loop, a **counter** is updated (in our example, the counter is the variable `i`). The counter is initialized to a certain value (here, at `i=0`) and is incremented at the end of each iteration (the strange notation `i++` means 'add one to `i`') until it reaches a certain stopping value (in our case 9, since the loop can only run as long as `i` is `< 10`).

It is common to see for loops with counters initialized at 0, since many data structures (such as lists or array) have an internal counter that starts at 0. To access the first element in a list, indeed, one uses the index 0 (and not 1!).

To process all files in the list, we use a for loop that iterates from 0 to the length of the file list minus 1 (since we start from zero!):

```java
for(i=0; i<list.length; i++) {
  ... statements ...
}
```

Each entry in the list corresponds to a file name from the picked directory. We now want to open each file in Fiji. For this we can use the `open()` function, that takes the full path of the file as an argument. In each iteration of the loop, we must then build the full path from the `dir` variable and the current list entry, like this:

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/macro3_loop_over_files.png
:width: 400px
:align: center

Loop over files and open them

```

If you run this macro on a directory full of images, you will open them all! Still, nothing will be done to those images. We need to move the original code that we wrote to process just on image into the for loop, so that the operations will be run on all images. We conclude the for loop by adding a `run("Close All");` call to make sure that all windows opened within one iteration of the loop are closed before the next iteration is started.

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/macro3_complete.png
:width: 400px
:align: center

Completed macro

```

Run the macro and pick the folder `data/fiji/programming/macro3`. You should get the following output:

```{figure} ./images_fiji_manual/macro3_result.png
:width: 300px
:align: center

Output of the cell count batch macro

```
